# Music-Player-HTML-CSS

In this project that I made while pursuing Web Development course from Coding Ninjas, I created the front-end design of a music player in HTML and CSS.

Main Homepage of the website is "index.html" and styling for the this html is done by external css called "stylesheet.css"and for the Playlist page html is "single Playlist Screen.html" and styling css is "Single Playlist Screen Style.css" and there are two more css files those for to make the pages more responsive and I don't think that you need to touch those and all the media(images) required for these pages are in the "media.zip" you need to extract this file.
